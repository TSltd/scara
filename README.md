# Scara robot for large-scale 3D printing using recycled plastic

Large scale 3D printing with recycled plastic has been a dream for quite a while now, but solutions have so far been expensive and still limited in size. So far nobody seems to have tried with a Scara style robot. 

Scara robots are perfectly suited to large scale 3D printing as the motors in Scara arms run perpendicular to gravity rather than fighting it. The weight of the machine hangs on the pivot axles and bearings.

Vertical movement is achieved with a lead screw. This is also a great solution as it delivers the high torque required at a slow speed, high speed vertical movements are not necessary in 3d printing as layer heights are just a few mm. 

I found this awsome Scara design on Grabcad which could easily be scaled up to carry a heavy printhead-
